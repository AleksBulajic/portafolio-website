## Projects
Memory-Card-Game
Test your memory skills with my interactive Memory Card Game! Match two cards and see how quickly you can complete the game. Built entirely by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Experience the power of a full CRUD application! I developed this project by integrating a 3rd party API, allowing users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through a seamless front-end and back-end interface. Comprehensive research and secure coding ensure a smooth experience. 


## MangaVerse
